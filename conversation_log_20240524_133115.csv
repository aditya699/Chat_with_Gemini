This process is used in nuclear power plants to generate electricity by creating controlled chain reactions in uranium or plutonium atoms. The energy released during fission can be harnessed to produce steam, which drives turbines connected to generators to produce electricity. However, nuclear fission also produces radioactive waste that must be carefully managed to prevent environmental contamination.",OpenAI GPT-3.5
