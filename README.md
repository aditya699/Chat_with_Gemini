# Inclusive.AI

Inclusive.AI is an innovative audio chatbot specifically designed to cater to the needs of Indian students who have limited access to teachers. With its intuitive Q&A interface, Inclusive.AI aims to empower these individuals by providing accurate, clear, and accessible responses to their academic inquiries.

In the Indian context, where the teacher-to-student ratio is significantly low, Inclusive.AI also offers features that can assist teachers. India has nearly 1.2 lakh schools with just one teacher each, highlighting the urgent need for technological interventions to support the education system. This application can help alleviate the burden on teachers by providing students with an additional resource for learning and understanding their coursework.

In the 2023-24 Union Budget, the Centre allocated Rs 1.13 lakh crore to education, yet many states still struggle with poor student-teacher ratios. Inclusive.AI can play a crucial role in bridging this gap by offering educational support to both students and teachers, especially in states with the most challenging student-teacher ratios.

Also since this app is mostly multimodal will help blind students as well.
